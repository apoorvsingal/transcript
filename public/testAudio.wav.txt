 Now I want to watch your emergency.
 Not again. One of the new features in the iPhones and Apple watches this year is called crash detection.
 Essentially it can automatically determine if it's been in a car crash and then call emergency services for you.
 So they do this by constantly sampling data from a bunch of sensors.
 So basically if the phone's GPS sees you're traveling very quickly and then the gyroscope and accelerometer feels some hard G-forces
 and then the microphone hears some loud crashing sounds, it's pretty sure you've been in a crash.
 So it'll ask you and then call 911 if you don't respond.
 But you know what else turns out to have almost the exact same set of circumstances happening to you and the phone in your pocket?
 A roller coaster. People have been going on theme park rides, accelerating fast, hitting high G-forces
 and hearing loud crashing sounds and their phones and watches have picked up on all that and started calling 911,
 sending law enforcement over and over again to the Joker roller coaster at Six Flags.
 So that's why you might now start to see signs like this warning you to turn your phone off or put in airplane mode.
 which is kind of hilarious, but also Apple, please try to fix this one.
